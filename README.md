# Nightlife Coordination App

## Objective

Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: http://whatsgoinontonight.herokuapp.com/ and deploy it to Heroku.

### User Stories

- As an unauthenticated user, I can view all bars in my area.

- As an authenticated user, I can add myself to a bar to indicate I am going there tonight.

- As an authenticated user, I can remove myself from a bar if I no longer want to go there.

- As an unauthenticated user, when I login I should not have to search again.
